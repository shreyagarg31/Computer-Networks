__Scenario__:
 There is a process S which reads messages using FIFOs from processes C1 and C2. A process D signals S based on user input and S sends it to one of the two groups    present in S (children of S) and the members of group print the received message accordingly.
 
 
 __Scenario2__:
 Each process identifies the other processes in network first and then after getting signal from a Process named F , start peer to peer conversation. F signals only when all processes in  network are ready for peer communication.
